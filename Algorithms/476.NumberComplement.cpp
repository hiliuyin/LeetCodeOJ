/*
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

Example 2:
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

int findComplement(int num) {
    int bits = 0;

        k >>= 1;
        bits++;
    }
    return (0xffffffff >> (32 - bits)) & ~num;
}

// A more elegant solution
int findComplement(int num) {
    int mask = ~0;
    while (mask & num != 0) {
        mask <<= 1;
    }
    return ~mask & ~num;
